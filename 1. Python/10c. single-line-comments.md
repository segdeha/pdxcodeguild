# Comments

If you want to write free-form information in your Python source, you can use **comments.**

Comments are any text after a `#`.

    # Anything can go here!
    three = 2 + 1  # You can put it after real Python, too!

Use comments to:

1. Remind yourself how a section of code works
1. Disable one version of code you’re trying out to compare to another version
1. As a to-do list for things you need to fill in later
