# Exercise: Create a Simple Login Form

## Objective

Create a simple login form using HTML.

1. Log in to [CodePen](http://codepen.io) and create a new pen
1. Copy and paste the following into the CSS panel: `label {display: block;}`
1. Create a form that meets the following requirements:
    - Form action is `https://example.com/login`
    - Form method is `POST`
    - Form contains a text input for the user’s username
    - Form contains a password input for the user’s password
    - Form contains a checkbox input for whether or not the site should remember the user’s login
    - Form contains two radio inputs with the name `newsletter` and the values `yes` and `no` (with `no` selected by default) to capture whether or not the user wants to receive the site’s newsletter
    - Form contains a select input for the user’s state (use the HTML from [this pen](http://codepen.io/segdeha/pen/gMpqdY?editors=1000) for the select list)
    - Form contains a button with the label `Submit`

Copy and paste the following into the CSS pane in your pen to help with formatting (I’ll explain what it does exactly when we start learning CSS):

    label {
        display: block;
    }

## Extra Credit

- Add more fields of varying types
- Try grouping related fields using the `<fieldset></fieldset>` tag
