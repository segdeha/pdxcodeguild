# Exercises in HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

This ought to keep you busy for a while….

- **Copy** this card under your name and check off the exercises as you complete them.
- All of the exercises can be completed as pens on [codepen.io](http://codepen.io) (you can fork [this pen](http://codepen.io/segdeha/pen/LZNvMV) and use it as your starting point for most of them)

Everyone should do the “easy” exercises. Intermediate and advanced exercises will be considered extra credit.

## Easy

- Implement a pen where, as the user types in a number into a text input, the number is shown below the input formatted with commas (in US English style)
- Implement a pen where the user can input a Roman numeral and the output is the number in Arabic numerals
- Implement a pen where an element on the page wobbles as closely as possible to the way an app icon wobbles on iOS when it’s ready to be deleted

## Intermediate

- Implement a pen where when the `<h1></h1>` is clicked, it animates to the right by `100px` over the course of `1s` (and back when clicked again)

## Advanced

- Implement a pen where as the user moves the mouse around the page, an image is revealed underneath the mouse (hint: use a CSS gradient mask to reveal the image underneath)
- Implement a pen that uses `window.requestAnimationFrame` (rather than CSS animations) to animate an element on the page
